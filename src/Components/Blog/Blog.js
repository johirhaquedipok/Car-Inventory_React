          <h4>Difference between javascript and nodejs</h4>
          <p>
            First of all, Javascript is a high-level, multi paradigm, dynamic
            programming langugage. On the Other hand,NodeJS is a Javascript
            runtime environment. Node. js built on google's v8 engine and gives
            us the abiliy to run javascript outside the browser.

          <h4>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h4>
          <p>
            MongoDb offers an API library that runs within a Nodejs
            application.MongoDB also has API libraries for other programming
            environments such as Python, Java, etc.... As a document database,
            MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or
            unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store
            documents.MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has
            become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable
            applications with evolving data schemas.

            Node Js is built on V8 engine and runs javascript so that we can use
            only Javascipt as the whole backen and front end project. And Node.
            js single-threaded dependent primarily used for non-blocking,
            event-driven servers. Most importantly it is suitable for scalable
            server-side job.

          <h4>Differences between sql and nosql databases</h4>
          <p>
            SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS).
            SQL databases are vertically scalable, SQL databases are
            table-based.SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions
          </p>
          <p>
            NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or
            distributed. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.NoSQL
            databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
            NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON

          <h4>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h4>
          <p>
            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
            information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
            signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
            cannot be altered after the token is issued
